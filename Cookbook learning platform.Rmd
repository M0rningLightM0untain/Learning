```{r printing stuff and the basics}
##cat is better than print at doing bits inbetween but cant do compound functions like lists and matrices 
cat("The error occurs at", 2*pi, "radians", "\n")
print(matrix(c(1,2,3,4), 2,2))

cat("\n", "Simple Square rooting", "\n")
x <- 3
y <- 4
z <- sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
print(z)

##finding out what objects exist with ls(), and ls.str()
x <- 10
y <- 8
z <- c("three", "blind", "mice")
f <- function(n, p) sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)
#ls.str()

##remove objects with rm()
#rm(x, y, z, f)
##remove all oblects
#rm(list = ls())
ls.str()
```
